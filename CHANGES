Version 1.0.1 - released 2010/Sep/12:

    Wind and navigation values are now stored when the App is shutdown;
    allows the user to switch between Whizwheel and other Apps without having
    to re-enter any information. The wind and direction boxes now allow "360"
    to be entered as a valid value; this will be treated as "000".
